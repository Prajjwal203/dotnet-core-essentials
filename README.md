# dotnet-core-essentials

A small ASP.NET Core Web API project demonstrating modern .NET fundamentals, clean architecture, dependency injection, and testing (unit + integration).

I've kept this project intentionally minimal to focus on correctness, structure, and best practices rather than features.

## Tech stack

- .NET (ASP.NET Core Web API)
- C# (async/await, records, nullable reference types)
- xUnit (unit testing)
- ASP.NET Core integration testing (`WebApplicationFactory`)
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- GitHub Actions (CI – added later)
